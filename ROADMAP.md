# unified-llm roadmap

This roadmap separates four gates: merge, release, publication, and flagship adoption. Passing one does not imply the next.

## Product boundary

Portfolio role: **reusable library or sdk**. Keep this as a small, independently versioned package. Samsarix Unified should consume it only through a public API adapter; private monorepo imports and copied implementations are out of scope.

Current disposition: Already integrated; roadmap changes should use an ordinary review branch.

## Stabilize the productized default

- Keep the default branch buildable from a clean checkout and preserve exact-head CI evidence.
- Keep Samsarix LLC branding, package identity, license metadata, and compatibility aliases internally consistent.
- Preserve the pre-productization default under a rollback ref before merging; do not delete legacy history.
- The productization SHA is already the remote default and its hosted checks pass.
- Completed in the next hardening increment: account for the exact outbound body, cap inbound response bytes and normalized structures, and validate custom adapters.
- Next: prove one canonical consumer and a capped live endpoint before publication.
- Review priority: prove one consumer, green wheel CI, one capped live endpoint, and trusted publication.

## Release candidate

- Build and install the wheel in a clean environment.
- Prove one real consumer and a versioned compatibility fixture.
- Publish only after package-name ownership, licensing, provenance, and rollback are recorded.

## Samsarix adoption

- Define a public API, event, schema, artifact, or deployment contract before connecting to Samsarix Unified.
- Add a consumer-owned contract fixture covering authentication, privacy, limits, errors, and version compatibility.
- Make one implementation canonical; remove or freeze duplicate behavior only after parity and rollback are proven.
- Record an owner, support level, compatibility window, and measurable adoption signal.

## Completion evidence

A milestone is complete only when its exact commit, commands and results, artifact digest, consumer or deployment, and rollback path are recorded in a pull request or release record. README claims must not exceed that evidence.
